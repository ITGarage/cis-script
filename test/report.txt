  5.1.1 Ensure cron daemon is enabled and running
- Description:
The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.

Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be 
removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy.

- Rationale:
While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have maintenance jobs that may 
include security monitoring that have to run, and cron is used to execute them.

current settings is:

  5.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured
- Description:
The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item make sure that root is 
the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can access the file.

Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be 
removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy.

- Rationale:
This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these files could provide 
unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access to these files could provide users 
with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way to gain 
unauthorized privileged access.

current settings is:

  5.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.hourly are configured
- Description:
This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on an hourly basis. The files in this directory cannot 
be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The 
commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from 
accessing this directory.

Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be 
removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy.

- Rationale:
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the means for gaining 
unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory could give an unprivileged user insight 
in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls.

  5.1.7 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.d are configured
- Description:
The /etc/cron.d directory contains system cron jobs that need to run in a similar manner to the hourly, daily 
weekly and monthly jobs from /etc/crontab, but require more granular control as to when they run. The files in 
this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using 
a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular 
users from accessing this directory.

Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be

  5.1.8 Ensure cron is restricted to authorized users
- Description:
Configure /etc/cron.allow to allow specific users to use this service. If /etc/cron.allow does not exist, then 
/etc/cron.deny is checked. Any user not specifically defined in this file is allowed to use cron. By removing the 
file, only users in /etc/cron.allow are allowed to use cron.

Notes:
  • Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be 
removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy
  • Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user
  • The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying 
cron jobs

- Rationale:
On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to 
control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a 
deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files.

  5.2.2 Ensure permissions on SSH private host key files are configured
- Description:
An SSH private key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this authentication method, The 
possession of the private key is proof of identity. Only a private key that corresponds to a public key will be 
able to authenticate successfully. The private keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the 
private key should be distributed.

- Rationale:
If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be impersonated.

current settings is:
  File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

  5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH public host key files are configured
- Description:
An SSH public key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this authentication method, a 
public key is a key that can be used for verifying digital signatures generated using a corresponding private key. 
Only a public key that corresponds to a private key will be able to authenticate successfully.

- Rationale:
If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised.

  5.2.4 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate
- Description:
LogLevel gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from sshd(8). The possible values are: 
QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2 and DEBUG3.

Note: The newer OpenSSH releases do not need a verbose mode setting anymore as the required SSH key activity 
information is written into the syslog by the default OpenSSH config

- Rationale:
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The DEBUG loglevels are specifically not 
recommended other than for strictly debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is 
difficult to identify important security information and may violate the privacy of users.
LogLevel INFO is the basic level that records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident 
Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can 
eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field

  5.2.5 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled
- Description:
The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote 
graphic connections.

- Rationale:
Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a 
small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised 
by other users on the X11 server.

Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.

current settings is:

  5.2.6 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less
- Description:
The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. When 
the login failure count reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the 
login failure.

Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive.

- Rationale:
Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the 
SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number based on site policy.

  5.2.7 Ensure SSH IgnoreRhosts is enabled
- Description:
The IgnoreRhosts parameter specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files will not be used in RhostsRSAAuthentication or 
HostbasedAuthentication.

- Rationale:
Setting this parameter forces users to enter a password when authenticating with ssh.

  5.2.8 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled
- Description:
The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of 
.rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only 
applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.

- Rationale:
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, disabling the ability to 
use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.

  5.2.9 Ensure SSH root login is disabled
- Description:
The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh. The default is no.

- Rationale:
Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own individual account, then 
escalating to root via sudo or su. This in turn limits opportunity for non-repudiation and provides a clear audit 
trail in the event of a security incident.

current settings is:

  5.2.10 Ensure SSH PermitEmptyPasswords is disabled
- Description:
The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts with empty password 
strings.

- Rationale:
Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the probability of unauthorized 
access to the system.

  5.2.11 Ensure SSH PermitUserEnvironment is disabled
- Description:
The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the ssh daemon.

- Rationale:
Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could potentially allow users to 
bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has ssh executing trojan'd programs).

  5.2.12 Ensure only strong Ciphers are used
- Description:
This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.

Notes:
  • Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved ciphers
  • Ensure that ciphers used are in compliance with site policy
  • The only "strong" ciphers currently FIPS 140-2 compliant are:
    ° aes256-ctr
    ° aes192-ctr
    ° aes128-ctr
  • Supported ciphers in openSSH 8.2:
3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, aes128-gcm@openssh.com, 
aes256-gcm@openssh.com, chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

- Rationale:
Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to provide 
confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised
  • The Triple DES ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which 
makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration 
encrypted session, aka a "Sweet32" attack
  • Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block 
Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary 
block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors

current settings is:

  5.2.13 Ensure only strong MAC algorithms are used
- Description:
This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.

Notes:
  • Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved MACs
  • Ensure that MACs used are in compliance with site policy
  • The only "strong" MACs currently FIPS 140-2 approved are:
    ° hmac-sha2-256
    ° hmac-sha2-512
  • The Supported MACs are:
hmac-md5, hmac-md5-96, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha1-96, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, umac-64@openssh.com,

umac-64-etm@openssh.com, umac-128-etm@openssh.com

- Rationale:
MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase exploitability in SSH downgrade 
attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with 
expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt 
the SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information.

  5.2.14 Ensure only strong Key Exchange algorithms are used
- Description:
Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing 
use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be 
equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received.

Notes:
  • Kex algorithms have a higher preference the earlier they appear in the list
  • Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved Key exchange algorithms
  • Ensure that Key exchange algorithms used are in compliance with site policy
  • The only Key Exchange Algorithms currently FIPS 140-2 approved are:

    ° ecdh-sha2-nistp384
    ° ecdh-sha2-nistp521
    ° diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
    ° diffie-hellman-group16-sha512
    ° diffie-hellman-group18-sha512
    ° diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
  • The Key Exchange algorithms supported by OpenSSH 8.2 are:

- Rationale:
Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange method may be weak because too few 
bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to 
man-in-the-middle attacks.

  5.2.15 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured
- Description:
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions.
  • ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the 
client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default 
is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client
  • ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any 
messages back from the client.
If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, 
terminating the session.
The default value is 3.
    ° The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel
    ° Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination
Example: If the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh 
session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.

Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive.

- Rationale:
Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh 
session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces 
this risk.
  • The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  • The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 3
  • The ssh session would send three keep alive messages at 5 minute intervals. If no response is received after 
the third keep alive message, the ssh session would be terminated after 15 minutes.

current settings is:
clientaliveinterval 0
clientalivecountmax 3

  5.2.16 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less
- Description:
The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The 
longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in 
this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is 
available for needed access.

Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive

- Rationale:
Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to 
the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended 
setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy.

current settings is:
120

  5.2.17 Ensure SSH access is limited
- Description:
There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is 
recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
  • AllowUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system
    ° The list consists of space separated user names
    ° Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable
    ° A system administrator may restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a 
particular host by specifying the entry as <user>@<host>
  • AllowGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the 
system
    ° The list consists of space separated group names
    ° Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable
  • DenyUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system
    ° The list consists of space separated user names
    ° Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable
    ° If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access 
from a particular host by specifying the entry as <user>@<host>
  • DenyGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the 
system
    ° The list consists of space separated group names
    ° Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable

- Rationale:
Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only authorized users access 
the system.

  5.2.18 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured
- Description:
The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user before authentication is 
permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.

- Rationale:
Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding connection. Presenting a 
warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

current settings is:
banner none

  5.2.19 Ensure SSH PAM is enabled
- Description:
UsePAM Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface. If set to “yes” this will enable PAM 
authentication using ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM account and 
session module processing for all authentication types.

- Rationale:
When usePAM is set to yes, PAM runs through account and session types properly. This is important if you want to 
restrict access to services based off of IP, time or other factors of the account. Additionally, you can make sure 
users inherit certain environment variables on login or disallow access to the server

current settings is:
usepam yes

score pattern is:
== sshd -T | grep -i 'usepam yes'

  5.2.20 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled
- Description:
SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or 
servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some 
system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home 
machines.

- Rationale:
Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors.
SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network 
monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used 
for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their 
unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network

current settings is:
allowtcpforwarding yes

score pattern is:
== sshd -T | grep -i 'allowtcpforwarding no'

  5.2.21 Ensure SSH MaxStartups is configured
- Description:
The MaxStartups parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon.

Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive.

- Rationale:
To protect a system from denial of service due to a large number of pending authentication connection attempts, 
use the rate limiting function of MaxStartups to protect availability of sshd logins and prevent overwhelming the 
daemon.

current settings is:
maxstartups 10:30:100

  5.2.22 Ensure SSH MaxSessions is limited
- Description:
The MaxSessions parameter specifies the maximum number of open sessions permitted from a given connection.

Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive.

- Rationale:
To protect a system from denial of service due to a large number of concurrent sessions, use the rate limiting 
function of MaxSessions to protect availability of sshd logins and prevent overwhelming the daemon.
