<div> </div> <div> </div>   5.1.1 Ensure cron daemon is enabled and running <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run, and cron is used to execute them. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> enabled </div> <div> active(running) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can access the file. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/crontab </div> <div> Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.hourly are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on an hourly basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/cron.hourly/ </div> <div> Access: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.daily are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The /etc/cron.daily directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a daily basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs.

The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges.

If /etc/cron.allow does not exist, then /etc/cron.deny is checked. Any user not specifically defined in this file is allowed to use cron. By removing the file, only users in /etc/cron.allow are allowed to use cron. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Notes: </div> <div>   • Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy </div> <div>   • Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user </div> <div>   • The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>  </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.1.9 Ensure at is restricted to authorized users <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> Configure /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use this service. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, then /etc/at.deny is checked. Any user not specifically defined in this file is allowed to use at. By removing the file, only users in /etc/at.allow are allowed to use at. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, at should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule at jobs. Using the at.allow file to control who can run at jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/at.deny </div> <div>   Size: 144       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file </div> <div> Device: 802h/2050d	Inode: 4981404     Links: 1 </div> <div> Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    1/  daemon) </div> <div> Access: 2020-08-16 12:49:35.177198214 +0300 </div> <div> Modify: 2018-11-12 19:11:53.000000000 +0200 </div> <div> Change: 2020-08-16 12:49:35.177198214 +0300 </div> <div>  Birth: - </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.1 Ensure permissions on /etc/ssh/sshd_config are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file contains configuration specifications for sshd. The command below sets the owner and group of the file to root. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged users. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/sshd_config </div> <div> Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.2 Ensure permissions on SSH private host key files are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> An SSH private key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this authentication method, The possession of the private key is proof of identity. Only a private key that corresponds to a public key will be able to authenticate successfully. The private keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the private key should be distributed. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be impersonated. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key </div> <div> Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key </div> <div> Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key </div> <div> Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key </div> <div> Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH public host key files are configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> An SSH public key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication. In this authentication method, a public key is a key that can be used for verifying digital signatures generated using a corresponding private key. Only a public key that corresponds to a private key will be able to authenticate successfully. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub </div> <div> Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub </div> <div> Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub </div> <div> Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>   File: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub </div> <div> Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root) </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.4 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> LogLevel gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from sshd(8). The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2 and DEBUG3. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: The newer OpenSSH releases do not need a verbose mode setting anymore as the required SSH key activity information is written into the syslog by the default OpenSSH config </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The DEBUG loglevels are specifically not recommended other than for strictly debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information and may violate the privacy of users. </div> <div> LogLevel INFO is the basic level that records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> loglevel INFO </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.5 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote graphic connections. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> x11forwarding yes </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.6 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number based on site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> 6 </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.7 Ensure SSH IgnoreRhosts is enabled <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The IgnoreRhosts parameter specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files will not be used in RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Setting this parameter forces users to enter a password when authenticating with ssh. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> ignorerhosts yes </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.8 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public key client host authentication.

The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client </div> <div>   • ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. </div> <div> If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. </div> <div> The default value is 3. </div> <div>     ° The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel </div> <div>     ° Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination </div> <div> Example: If the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen).

The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div> 120 </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:red"><b>not scored (skipped)</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.17 Ensure SSH access is limited <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged: </div> <div>   • AllowUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system </div> <div>     ° The list consists of space separated user names </div> <div>     ° Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable </div> <div>     ° A system administrator may restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host by specifying the entry as <user>@<host> </div> <div>   • AllowGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system </div> <div>     ° The list consists of space separated group names </div> <div>     ° Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable </div> <div>   • DenyUsers - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system </div> <div>     ° The list consists of space separated user names </div> <div>     ° Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable </div> <div>     ° If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host by specifying the entry as <user>@<host> </div> <div>   • DenyGroups - Gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system </div> <div>     ° The list consists of space separated group names </div> <div>     ° Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only authorized users access the system. </div> <div>  </div> <div> current settings is: </div> <div>  </div> <div>  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p style="color:green"><b>scored</b></p> <div> </div> <div> </div>   5.2.18 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured <div> </div> <div> - Description: </div> <div> The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding connection.

It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines. </div> <div>  </div> <div> - Rationale: </div> <div> Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. </div> <div> SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions.
